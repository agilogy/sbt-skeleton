sbt-skeleton
============

A bare project mainly for environment setup and testing. 
BONUS: While the purpose of this repo is helping newbies get their machines ready 
for some scala developing, the project in the repo includes dependencies to 
scala-test and specs2 and provides few test samples of a Fake class.

### STEPS

Please clone and run:

```
 sbt
```

When in the console (if it opened) use the command:

```
 > test
```

to run the tests. If this is your first time using SBT you'll need internet connetion and this first execution might take time downloading the whole interwebs.

###Â GETTING HELP

If you find issues and get stuck, please ask away on github-issues or 
join the discussions at http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Developers-Barcelona/ 

### IDE

Once you are certain sbt runs and tests are all green, make sure you get yourself 
a decent IDE to start coding. Just anything you are comfortable with (no need to 
download and install a fully fledged scalaIDE).
